# LED Flasher
## _Circuit to flash 2 LEDs_

This is another simple project to continue my learning with Altium. It consist on a board with a 555 Timer and a couple of LEDs. What the circuit does is to turn on two LEDs in alternation, they would be configured in "toggle" mode. When one LED is on, the other is off and vice versa.

### What I learnt in this project:

- Board Design: I have used a circular board for the very first time.

### Some pictures of how the circuit schematics and PCB layout looks like:
