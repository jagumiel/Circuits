## _LED Circuit_

This was my first Altium Project. It is just a 2 pin connector with a resistor and a LED connected in series. The functionality is to turn on a LED when Vcc is applied.
### What I learnt in this project:

- Generating an Altium schematic.
- Importing components.
- Making a board for fabrication
	- GND plane
	- Fiducials
	- Gerbers
	- ...

### Some pictures of how the circuit schematics and PCB layout looks like:
