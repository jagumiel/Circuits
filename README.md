# Circuits
I need a repository to keep track of the electronic designs I have made and built.

Additionally, I'm taking advantage of this same repository to publish Altium projects. In 2022 I have started to use this tool for the assisted design of PCBs, so I am taking the opportunity to make a version of my projects in Altium and improve my skills little by little.

Someday I will try to put some order, I hope!
