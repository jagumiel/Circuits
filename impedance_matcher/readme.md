# Impedance Matcher for Electric Guitar
## _Connect your guitar to an electronic device without loosing sound quality_


This circuit allows to connect your instrument to a line-in without loosing quality. This may happen when you connect your guitar to a computer or an embedded device.

Here is the [project's documentation](https://jagumiel.xyz/pdfs/ImpedanceMatcher.pdf). It's a pdf document written in Spanish, but contains all the details. If you prefer a shorter version, you can [read the resume on my blog.](https://jagumiel.xyz/blog/2018/06/04/mejorando-un-adaptador-de-impedancia/)

I will try to update this readme.md with some details in English soon.
